# vis
Mapped-based data visualisations, often of London and/or transport/transit.

* vis/tube - see it live at http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/ and http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/closures/ with more information at http://oobrien.com/2014/01/london-tube-stats/ and http://oobrien.com/2014/10/tube-tongues/

Probably of most interest is https://github.com/oobrien/vis/blob/master/tube/data/tfl_lines.json and https://github.com/oobrien/vis/blob/master/tube/data/tfl_stations.json - these data are from OpenStreetMap, with some minor editing by myself. They include the Crossrail alignment. They are simplified to only show one line for each running tunnel pair, and stations represented by a node on the line.
